== Changelog ==

= 0.02 =

* Changed the way of calling the plugin, now it's done via an array of options. See the documentation for more info;
* Now it works with multisite. There's no absolute way of make it work. Some servers and websites will need a different parse to get the images path;
* There's a verification to check if "get-the-image" is also installed.

= 0.01 =
Plugin released. Don't expect multisite to work.
